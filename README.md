This repository explores the theoretical continuity between physical signal phenomena and modern command-based computing systems.

Rather than treating commands as abstract symbols detached from physics, we model them as stabilized interpretations of continuous signals—filtered through timing, thresholds, and shared conventions.

The goal is not to propose an alternative operating system today, but to preserve a conceptual framework that may become actionable as computational, spatial, and AI-assisted systems evolve.
