# Civilized RF

This repository explores the theoretical continuity between physical signal phenomena and modern command-based computing systems.

Rather than treating commands as abstract symbols detached from physics, we model them as **stabilized interpretations of continuous signals** — filtered through timing, thresholds, and shared conventions.

The goal is not to propose an alternative operating system today, but to preserve a **conceptual framework** that may become actionable as computational, spatial, and AI-assisted systems evolve.

## Scope

Civilized RF is a **conceptual and exploratory repository**.  
It does not attempt to deliver production software, performance benchmarks, or immediate implementations.

Instead, it focuses on:
- Preserving ideas that do not yet fit cleanly into existing system models
- Describing command execution as a signal-processing problem
- Examining how interpretation, noise, and intent shape computation
