Commands are signals. Meaning emerges from constraint, timing, and decay.
Civilized RF — Manifesto

Computing systems are commonly described as discrete, symbolic, and abstract—seemingly divorced from the continuous physical world that produces them. This repository challenges that framing.

We propose that commands are not fundamentally symbolic objects, but stabilized interpretations of continuous physical signals. Discreteness arises not from nature, but from observation, quantization, and agreement.
